### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (version 12.0 or later)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Running the Development Server

This will start the server at `http://localhost:3000`. You can view your application in the browser.

### Building for Production

To build the application for production, run:

npm run build
```

This will create an optimized version of your application in the `.next` directory.

### Usage

- The main entry point of the application is located at `src/pages/index.js`.
- You can add global styles in `src/styles/globals.css`.
- Tailwind CSS styles can be applied throughout the application using utility classes from `src/styles/tailwind.css`.
- An example component demonstrating Tailwind CSS usage can be found in `src/components/ExampleComponent.js`.

### API Routes

You can define API routes in the `src/pages/api` directory. An example API route is provided at `src/pages/api/hello.js`, which responds with a JSON object.

### Customization

You can customize Tailwind CSS by modifying the `tailwind.config.js` file. Additionally, you can configure PostCSS in `postcss.config.js`.
